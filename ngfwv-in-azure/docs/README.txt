Cisco NGFWv (FTDv) template deployment in Microsoft Azure Public Cloud
=========================================

Following JSON template is posted here on GitHub as an example of how to deploy NGFWv (FTDv) into existing Availability Set.
Currently, Azure console allows you to deploy NGFWv (FTDv) only into a new Availability set.  Published template also allows for
quicker workflow, scripted deployment, and ability to deploy multiple NGFWv (FTDv) into the same availability set.  Multiple
NGFWv (FTDv) devices in the same availability set allow for load-balancing to these firewalls and ability to offer stateless HA.
